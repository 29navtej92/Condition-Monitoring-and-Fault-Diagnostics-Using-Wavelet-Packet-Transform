# Condition-Monitoring-and-Fault-Diagnostics-Using-Wavelet-Packet-Transform
This project is accomplished in MATLAB. The projectâ€™s goal is to use the Wavelet Packet Transformation (WPT) method to monitor the condition of a system. Wavelet Theory is the culmination of the work of different scientific fields that have utilized it freely. Wavelet filter banks and multiresolution signal analyses have been unified into a structure of a solitary hypothesis. The data can be analyzed to identify a fault in the system. Using multi-rate filter banks and wavelet transform, we can extract the critical information of the signal. Using data from a known normal-condition system as a baseline. WPT is applied to both the baseline and current data. By comparing the Wave Packet Coefficients of baseline data with that of the current data, fault conditions in the system could be identified.
